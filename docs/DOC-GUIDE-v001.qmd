title: "DOC-GUIDE-v001.qmd"

This document describes the various types of documentation files and the
version numbering scheme.

## Reading the docs as an HTML book

The documentation in `docs/` can be rendered as a single **Quarto book** (HTML) for easier reading. To build or rebuild the book after documentation changes, see **[QUARTO-DOC-GUIDE.qmd](QUARTO-DOC-GUIDE.qmd)**. That guide explains how to install the Quarto tools (if needed) and how to regenerate the book. The built book is in `docs/_book/`; open `docs/_book/index.html` in a browser to read it.

In the book, the sidebar (table of contents) lists each chapter, and the page title is usually the same as the document’s heading or filename. **Exception:** the chapter that displays the repository README is built from `Overview.qmd`, which only includes `README.md`. In the sidebar it appears as **README**; on the webpage, the top-level heading is taken directly from `README.md` (e.g. “yrS3 — Tutorial & Testing System”), not from the Overview filename. Edit only `README.md` to change that content; the book updates automatically when rebuilt.

## v001 version format

In general, any document (including this one) can have a -v001 format style 
version number at the end of its name. 
This notation is used to ensure that it is easy to compare
different versions of the same document - without needing to know how to use
GIT commands.

## SPEC documents

This system will be continuously developed in an incremental way.
Each incremental development phase will be versioned in 0.0.1 style.
Each incremental development phase will have a spec document named SPEC-v0.0.1.md
or something similar, where the version number for the spec matches the 
version number of the release.

## PRD documents

PRD stands for Product Requirements Document.
In this project, a PRD is a living document that describes the goals and vision for the full system—closer to a product vision than to a minimal "requirements list."
The project relies heavily on LLM-assisted coding, and **PRD** is a term that LLMs recognize and understand, so the files are named PRD (e.g. `PRD-0.0.1-v001.qmd`) and this guide uses that term for consistency.

The names of PRD documents e.g. PRD-0.0.1-v001 represent (a) the SPEC version
that was active at the time the PRD was modified, as well as a 2ndary ver number.
The ver number at the end of the name of a PRD document represents different
versions of the PRD for a particular incremental development step.
If the PRD was not modified at a particular incremental development step, then
no new PRD version would be created at that step and the PRD version number will remain
unchanged for that step. Therefore the PRD version numbers could skip numbers, for example
if the PRD was modified when SPEC-v0.0.1 was created and then again when SPEC-v0.0.5
was created then the only versions of the PRD would be PRD-v0.0.1 and PRD-v0.0.5.
