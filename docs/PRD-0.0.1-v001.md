I would like to design a PRD for a project to build a tutorial/testing system. Please put the following ideas into a PRD in markdown format. Help me revise the document. Ask me questions that would help. Organize the ideas into appropriate sections, etc.

Version 0.1 will focus primarily on the testing component.

The system should allow for authentication by users with Google OAuth.

The system should use Supabase and Vercel for the infrastrucutre.

The web system should use NextJS.

I want to use AI coding assistants to design and code the system. Therfore I would like to split up the system into small manageable components and then hook them together. Each component should be able to be designed and tested on its own to minimize the complexity of each component.

The system will initially be used for testing knowledge in the following areas:

- R coding
- Bash commands and coding
- Excel Formulas
- Excel Pivot Tables
- Excel Charts
- HTML
- CSS

The system should allow for different types of questions. Each question type should be implemented in a separate system module. Examples of question types:

- multiple choice
- short answer (gradeable with AI by looking to see that provided answer matches the question's expected answer)
- long answer (gradeable with AI by looking to see that provided answer matches the question's expected answer)
- R coding question - expected answer is provided as working R code that produces a result. The submitted answer's results are compared to the expected answer's result. The system should generate a few different inputs and for each one compare the results of the system's answer code to the submitted answer code. If there are discrepencies the results should be communicated back as the reason for why the answer wasn't toally correct.
- Bash commands - similar in concep to R coding question
- Excel formulas - Similar in concept to R coding question
- HTML code
- CSS code
